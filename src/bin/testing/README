These files are compiled into the binaries that we then use as the processes for
ptools to inspect in our tests.

These binaries are intended to be started by the test process. The typical
structure for these programs will be
 - Set up some state
 - Signal to test that it is ready to be inspected by the ptool being tested
 - Wait for the ptool to be run and then to be killed by the test process
