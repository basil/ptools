The example applications have to be built before the tests can be run. Otherwise the tests will fail with a cryptic message because the example applications are missing. Migrate any content from examples/README into CONTRIBUTING.md and delete examples/README.\n- How to view the manual pages.\n- Various linters and how to run them (clippy, cargo fmt, markdownlint). See .github/workflows/build.yml for how the CI build runs these.","status":"open","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","owner":"me@basilcrow.com","created_at":"2026-02-20T10:14:55.26360047-08:00","created_by":"Basil Crow","updated_at":"2026-02-20T10:27:30.195081737-08:00"}
